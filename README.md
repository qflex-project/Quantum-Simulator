# Quantum Simulator

In this repository is avaluable the codes related to HybriD-GM model. This model was conceived as a computational methodology for quantum computing simulations and targeted to classical parallel hybrid architecture to assist the study of quantum algorithms better. 

The HybriD-GM explores High-Performance Computing (HPC) potentialities to improve performance by (i) optimizing resources and enabling hardware-independent scalability; and (ii) exploring composition and projection operators, also including coalescing memory management. Both strategies act on quantum structures in order to obtain a hybrid structure integrating CPU and/or GPU architectures.
